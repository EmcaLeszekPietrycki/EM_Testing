# Geomap

Energy Monitor allows the display of specified point of interest on the world map. If you have hosts or services in different locations, you can add them as pins on the map, the pins will display their current status, the same way it would be shown in **"Monitor" -> Hosts -> All Hosts** menu. 

## Setting up the Geomap

**Enter "Monitor" -> Geomap**

- **Edit Mode**

    Edit mode will allow the administrator to place a "**pin**" on the map, by double clicking the left mouse button. You can tell if the edit mode is active because the mouse pointer will change the icon to a hand. 

    After double clicking, you will be prompted to add the location

The administrator can add several descriptions to the pin, such as address, geographical coordinates, what sort of object the pin is referring and picking a specific object from the Energy Monitor database.

- Coordinates are calculated automatically.

- Object's status will reflect it's actual status.

- **Link**       

    After placing a ping you will can link them together. Link is shown as a purely visual grey line, and there is no underlying logic behind it. 

    An example usage scenario could be placing a specifc switch interface as a pin in location A, then a second interface, connected to the first one, in location B, to help visualize this connection.
