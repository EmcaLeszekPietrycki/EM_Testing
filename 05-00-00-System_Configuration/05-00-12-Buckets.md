# Buckets

Buckets are a functionality in Energy Monitor that allows the administrator to set up predefined metrics/services in a **"Bucket"** object, which can be chosen during **"Network Autoscan"** Functionality.

## Configuring buckets

1. Enter "**Manage**" -> "**Configure**" -> "**Bucket Templates**"

2. Assign name of your bucket

3. Assign services/metrics you wish your bucket to contain. 

4. Save the changes into the database.

Metrics can be assigned from various hosts. 

It is recommended to create a "dummy host" which will house all such metrics, for ease and convenience of future modifications of the bucket.
