# Templates - Host and Services

Templates allow you to set a blueprint for a particular type of hosts or services. 

For instance, the company has a basic configuration for a switch, the administrator might want to set up a template to include that base config in every switch that will be added into the system, removing a lot of repetetive work. 

## Setting up a template

1. Enter "**Manage**" -> "**Configure**" -> "**Host/Service/Contact Templates**"
